## What I'm Learning & Building

I'm a computer science student focused on building strong programming foundations and learning machine learning through hands-on projects.

I care about writing clean code that actually works. I test my functions. I handle errors. I write code that I can understand when I come back to it later.

Still learning. Making progress every day.

## Core Skills

### Programming (Priority #1)

**Python** — My main language. Comfortable with it. Still improving.

**SQL** — Can query databases, join tables, aggregate data. Learning more complex queries.

**Git** — Know the basics: commit, branch, merge, pull requests. Use it for all my projects.

**Clean Code** — Writing functions that do one thing. Using clear variable names. Making my code readable.

**Testing** — Learning to write unit tests with pytest. Slowly making it a habit.

### Math (Practical Approach)

I focus on understanding concepts, not memorizing formulas.

**Linear Algebra** — Understand matrix multiplication and what transformations do. Enough to work with data.

**Statistics** — Know when to use mean vs median. Understand variance and distributions. Learning evaluation metrics.

**Calculus** — Understand how gradient descent works conceptually. I don't manually derive equations.

**My View** — I need intuition to implement algorithms. I learn math as I need it for projects.

## Tools I Use

### Data Work
- pandas — Data manipulation
- NumPy — Numerical operations
- SQL — Querying databases

### Machine Learning
- scikit-learn — My go-to for most ML tasks
- XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost — Gradient boosting models
- PyTorch — Still learning, use it for deep learning projects

### Visualization
- Matplotlib — Basic plots
- Seaborn — Statistical visualizations
- Plotly — Interactive plots

### Development
- Git / GitHub — Version control
- Jupyter — Experimenting and learning
- VS Code — Main editor
- pytest — Unit testing (learning)

### Deployment (Learning)
- Flask / FastAPI — Building simple APIs
- Docker — Basic understanding
- AWS / GCP — Just the basics

## How I Approach Projects

1. **Start with the data** — Look at it first. Check for missing values. Plot distributions.

2. **Keep it simple** — Begin with basic models. Linear regression before neural networks.

3. **Validate properly** — Split data correctly. Check for leakage. Use cross-validation.

4. **Make it work, then make it better** — Get something running first. Optimize later.

5. **Test edge cases** — What happens with null values? Empty inputs? Wrong types?

6. **Document as I go** — Write comments. Explain why, not just what.

7. **Learn from mistakes** — Debug thoroughly. Understand what went wrong.

## Currently Learning

**Right now:**
- Deep learning fundamentals with PyTorch
- Better software engineering practices
- How to deploy models (FastAPI + Docker)
- Writing better tests

**Completed:**
- Multiple Kaggle competitions (still learning from each one)
- End-to-end ML projects from data collection to deployment
- Building APIs with Flask

**Working on:**
- Computer vision projects
- NLP basics
- Building a portfolio of solid projects

**Not doing:**
- Chasing every new framework
- Focusing on theory without implementation
- Building projects I don't understand

---

## My Learning Philosophy

I learn by building. I understand by implementing.

I don't just run code from tutorials. I break things, debug them, and understand why they work.

I value fundamentals over shortcuts. Strong programming skills matter more than knowing 50 libraries.

I'm comfortable saying "I don't know this yet" and then learning it.
