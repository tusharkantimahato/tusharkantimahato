## What I Do

I write code that solves problems. My focus is machine learning and data systems.

I test everything. I handle edge cases. I write code that doesn't break at 3 AM.

**Current work:**
- Building ML models that perform in production
- Working with real datasets, not toy examples
- Learning by shipping projects

**Learning:**
- Deep learning architectures
- Model optimization and deployment
- Data pipeline engineering

---

## Stack

**Core:** Python, SQL, C++

**ML/AI:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Hugging Face

**Data:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Tools:** Jupyter, Git, VS Code, Docker

**Platforms:** Azure, Kaggle, Google Colab

---

## Approach

1. Understand the problem
2. Write clean code
3. Test thoroughly
4. Ship it
5. Iterate based on feedback

I don't chase trends. I focus on fundamentals.

I don't oversell. I deliver.
